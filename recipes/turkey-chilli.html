    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This turkey chili recipe is very simple but hearty with plenty of flavors â€” it's even better on the second day! I serve this chili with low-fat Cheddar cheese and low-fat sour cream. It's also delicious with crackers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can canned kidney beans - drained, rinsed, and mashed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
