    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate peanut butter protein bars are easy to make in a small batch, and absolutely delicious. Using a good protein powder is the key. If there is a downside, it might be how hard it will be to only eat one.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vanilla protein powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Line an 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides to make it easy to remove bars from the pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place peanut butter, protein powder, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in a bowl and mix until well combined; press into the prepared pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chocolate chips and oil in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir. Repeat until chips are completely melted when stirred. Pour over bars, smooth chocolate. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Cut into 8 bars.</li>
